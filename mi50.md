Please see my original post that posted about this journey - https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jy5p12/another_budget_build_160gb_of_vram_for_1000_maybe/ This will be up to par to readily beat DIGITs and the AMD MAX AI integrated 128gb systems.... Sorry, I'm going to dump this before I get busy for anyone that might find it useful. So I bought 10 MI50 gpus for $90 each $900. Octominer case for $100. But I did pay $150 for the shipping and $6 tax for the case. So there you go $1156. I also bought a PCIe ethernet card for 99cents. $1157. Octominer XULTRA 12 has 12 PCIe slots, it's designed for mining, it has weak celeron CPU, the one I got has only 4gb of ram. But it works and is a great system for low budget GPU inference workload. I took out the SSD drive and threw an old 250gb I had lying around and installed Ubuntu. Got the cards working, went with rocm. vulkan was surprising a bit problematic, and rocm was easy once I figured out. Blew up the system the first attempt and had to reinstall for anyone curious, I installed 24.04 ubuntu, MI50 is no longer supported on the latest roc 6.4.0, but you can install 6.3.0 so I did that. Built llama.cpp from source, and tried a few models. I'll post data later. Since the card has 12 slots, it has 1 8 pin for each slot, for a total of 12 cables. The cards have 2 8 pin each, so I had a choice, use an 8 pin to dual 8 pin cable or 2 to 1. To play it safe for starters, I did 2 to 1. For a total of 6 cards installed. The cards also supposedly have a peak of 300watts, so 10 cards would be 3000 watts. I have 3 power supplies of 750watts for a total of 2250watts. The cool thing about the power supply is that it's hot swappable, I can plug in and take out while it's running. You don't need all 3 to run, only 1. The good news is that this thing doesn't draw power! The cards are a bit high idle at about 20watts, so 6 cards 120watts, system idles really at < 130 watts. I'm measuring at the outlet with an electrical measurement meter. During inference across the cards, peak was about 340watt. I'm using llama.cpp so inference is serial and not parallel. You can see the load move from one card to the other. This as you can guess is "inefficient" so llama.cpp is not as far as say using vLLM with tensor parallel. But it does support multi users, so you can push it by running parallel requests if you are sharing the rig with others, running agents or custom code. In such a situation, you can have the cards all max out. I didn't power limit the cards, system reports them at 250watts, I saw about 230watt max while inferring. The case fan at 100% sounds like a jet engine, but the great thing is they are easy to control and at 10% you can't hear it. The cards run cooler than my Nvidia cards that are on an open rig, my Nvidia cards idle at 30-40C, these cards idle in the 20C range with 5% fan. I can't hear the fan until about 25% and it's very quiet and blends in. It takes about 50-60% before anyone that walks into the room will notice. I just cut and paste and took some rough notes, I don't have any blogs or anything to sell, just sharing for those that might be interested. One of the cards seems to have issue. llama.cpp crashes when I try to use it both local and via RPC. I'll swap and move it around to see if it makes a difference. I have 2 other rigs, llama.cpp won't let me infer across more than 16 cards. I'm spending time trying to figure it out, updated the *_MAX_DEVICES and MAX_BACKENDS, MAX_SERVERS in code from 16 to 32, it sometimes works. I did build with -DGGML_SCHED_MAX_BACKENDS=48 makes no difference. So if you have any idea, let me know. :) Now on power and electricity. Save it, don't care. With that said, the box idles at about 120watts, my other rigs probably idle more. Between the 3 rigs, maybe idle of 600watts. I have experimented with "wake on lan" That means I can suspend the machines and then wake them up remotely. One of my weekend plans is to put a daemon that will monitor the GPUs and system, if idle and nothing going on for 30 minutes. Hibernate the system, when I'm ready to use them wake them up remotely. Do this for all rig and don't keep them running. I don't know how loaded models will behave, my guess is that it would need to be reloaded, it's "vram" aka "RAM" after all, and unlike system ram that gets saved to disk, GPU doesn't. I'm still shocked at the low power use. So on PCIe electrical x1 speed. I read it was 1GBps, but hey, there's a difference from 1Gbps and that. So PCie3x1 is capable of 985 MB/s. My network cards are 1Gbps which are more around 125 MB/s. So upgrading to a 10Gbps network should theoretically allow for much faster load. 7x. In practice, I think it would be less. llama.cpp hackers are just programmers getting it done by any means necessary, the goal is to infer models not the best program, from my wandering around the rpc code today and observed behavior it's not that performant. So if you're into unix network programming and wanna contribute, that would be a great area. ;-) With all this said, yes, for a just about $1000, 160gb of vram is sort of possible. There was a lot of MI50 on ebay and I suppose some other hawks saw them as well and took their chance so it's sold out. Keep your eyes out for deals. I even heard I didn't get the best deal, some lucky sonomabbb got the MI50's that were 32gb. It might just be that companies might start replacing more of their old cards and we will see more of these or even better ones. Don't be scared, don't worry about that mess of you need a power plant and it's no longer supported. Most of the things folks argued about on here are flat out wrong from my practical experience, so risk it all. Oh yeah, largest model I did run was llama405b, and had it write code and was getting about 2tk/s. Yes it's a large dense model. It would perform the worse, MoE like deepseekv3, llama4 are going to fly. I'll get some numbers up on those if I remember to. Future stuff.
Decide if I'm going to pack all the GPUs in one server or another server. From the load observed today, one server will handle it fine. Unlike newer Nvidia GPUs with cable going in from the top, this one has the cables going in from the back and it's quite a tight fit to get in. PCI standards from what I understand expect cards to pull a max of 75w and an 8pin cable can supply 150w, for a max of 225w. So I could power them with a single cable, figure out how to limit power to 200w and be good to go. As a matter of fact, some of the cables had those adapter and I took them out. I saw a video of a crypto bro running an Octominer with 3080s and those have more power demand than MI50s. Here goes data from my notes. llama3.1-8b-instruct-q8 inference, same prompt, same seed

If you are paying attention MI50s are not great at prompt processing. a little bit larger context, demonstrates that MI50 sucks at prompt processing... and demonstrating performance over RPC. I got these to see if I could use them via RPC for very huge models.

max inference over RPC observed with rocm-smi was 100w, lower than when running locally, saw 240w max watt observed at outlet before RPC was 361w, max watt after 361w llama-70b-q8 if you want to approximate how fast it will run in q4, just multiple by 2. This was done with llama.cpp, yes vLLM is faster, someone already did q4 llama8 with vLLM and tensor parallel for 25tk/s

Misc notes
idle watt at outlet = 126watts
temp about 25-27C across GPUs
idle power across individual 21-26watts
powercap - 250watts
inference across 3GPUs at outlet - 262watts
highest power on one GPU = 223W
at 10% speed, fan got to 60C, at 20% speed highest is 53C while GPU is active.
turned up to 100% it brought the GPUs down to high 20's in under 2 minutes
